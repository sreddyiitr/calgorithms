# Data Structures

## Abstract Data Types
* Stack or Quueue etc. They offer operations such as push pop etc, which can be used to insert or remove elements from the array. 
  - But, we dont need to know how they coded push or pop functions in a stack/queue. 

## Data Stuctures
* Data structures are how about a specific function is implemented
* There are different ways of impplementing data structures, the solution depends on what the user wants (Fast response time or Less Storage)
* There is no single universal solution for all problems. Depending on user's need, we can optimize on time or storage

### Linear Data Structures
* Array, Stack, Queue, LinkedList etc
  - Static data structure: We know the size at complie time. Faster access, but slower inserts/deletes. Example: Arrays
  - Dynamic data structure: Memory will be allocated at run time. Faster inserts/deletes, slower reads. Example: LinkedList

### Non-Linear Data Structures
* Trees, Graphs etc
